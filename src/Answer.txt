Answers are in the file answer_v1.c

I have written everything in C. Actually went out of my way not to use C++ 
and realized that it was in the first assignement (the MP3 player) that ANSI-C
was a requirement and not this one. I have used POSIX only interfaces (at least
I think I did) - I've followed this 
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/. I have made sure that the 
functions that I was using were part of the QNX Neutrino API but I guess that 
since QNX is fully POSIX it should be OK. 

It should compile on any Linux device using the following command
 $ gcc -Wall -D_REENTRANT answer_v1.c -lpthread -o answer

I have used Cygwin and gcc v3.4.4 to compile.
